## Visual Semantic Planning (VSP)

This is work based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08080 . It is an experiment with non-determinism in the Markov Decision Process as proposed in the paper. It is applied to a new domain, a MNIST MDP. This is essentially a game where the state space lies over [0-9] x [0-9]. 

I find that non-determinism in MDPs greatly confuses imitation learning algorithms and hinders accuracy.
